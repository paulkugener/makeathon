# make@on
Basic information for the different make@on projects during 'Concours Jonk Fuerscher 2017' on april 1st and 2nd in 'Forum Geessekn√§ppchen'.


## Projects overview
XXX different projects were prepared:
* Project1: Halli-Galli
* Project2: Robot-Arm-Goalie
* Project3: Balance-Disc
* Project4: 8x8-Matrix-Game
* Project5:
* Project6:


## Project1: Halli-Galli
### description
Reaction game played by 4 people. Each player has an LED-strip of 5 Neopixel LEDs, which are randomly lit per round. A large button in the middle of the playing field must be pushed as fast as possible if a certain number and color of LEDs are activated. The fastest player wins the round.
### components
* Arduino Mega?
* NeoPixel strips
* Push-buttons
* Seven-Segment display
* Buzzer
* Toggle switch
* (just ask if you want to try other components)


## Project2: Robot-Arm-Goalie
### description
First you should assemble the arm and test the manual steerage of the arm with the controller. The next step should be to make the arm react autonomously.
### components
* Robot-Arm (Info-Link?)
* Sensor?
* Arduino?


## Project3: Balance-Disc
### description
In the traditional game the goal is to balance a ball on a disc and go through an obstacle track. The disk is held by 3-6 people over cords. Now our objective is to use a sensor to measure the inclination of the disc and use different components to return the output of the sensor.
### components
* Arduino
* MPU6050 (see MPU6050-folder for starting code)
* LCD-display
* NeoPixel strips or single LEDs
* Buzzer
* Toggle switch
* Power supply
* (just ask if you want to try other components)


## Project4: 8x8-Matrix-Game
### description
First you should connect the joystick with the arduino and take a look at the readings. Then you should connect the 8x8-LED-Matrix with the arduino and check if you can display something. Now the next step is to create a game (i.e. snake, pong, etc). You can also develop your own game. At this stage some group-members should develop a case to hold the components and the power supply.
### components
* Arduino
* Joystick
* 8x8-LED-Matrix (MAX7219)
* Buzzer
* Toggle switch
* Power supply
* (just ask if you want to try other components)


## Project5: Kletterpfad / "Climb the path"
