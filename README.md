# make@on
Basic information for the different make@on projects during 'Concours Jonk Fuerscher 2017' on april 1st and 2nd in 'Forum Geessekn√§ppchen'.


## Projects overview
7 different projects were prepared:
* Project1: Halli-Galli
* Project2: Robot-Arm-Goalie
* Project3: Balance-Disc
* Project4: 8x8-Matrix-Game
* Project5: Kletterpfad / "Climb the path"
* Project6: Maze
* Project7: React-Game


## Project1: Halli-Galli
### description
Reaction game played by 4 people. Each player has an LED-strip of 5 Neopixel LEDs, which are randomly lit per round. A large button in the middle of the playing field must be pushed as fast as possible if a certain number and color of LEDs are activated. The fastest player wins the round.
### components
* Arduino Mega?
* NeoPixel strips
* Push-buttons
* Seven-Segment display
* Buzzer
* Toggle switch
* (just ask if you want to try other components)


## Project2: Robot-Arm-Goalie
### description
First you should assemble the arm and test the manual steerage of the arm with the controller. The next step should be to make the arm react autonomously.
### components
* Robot-Arm (Info-Link?)
* Sensor?
* Arduino?


## Project3: Balance-Disc
### description
In the traditional game the goal is to balance a ball on a disc and go through an obstacle track. The disk is held by 3-6 people over cords. Now our objective is to use a sensor to measure the inclination of the disc and use different components to return the output of the sensor.
### components
* Arduino
* MPU6050 (see MPU6050-folder for starting code)
* LCD-display
* NeoPixel strips or single LEDs
* Buzzer
* Toggle switch
* Power supply
* (just ask if you want to try other components)


## Project4: 8x8-Matrix-Game
### description
First you should connect the joystick with the arduino and take a look at the readings. Then you should connect the 8x8-LED-Matrix with the arduino and check if you can display something. Now the next step is to create a game (i.e. snake, pong, etc). You can also develop your own game. At this stage some group-members should develop a case to hold the components and the power supply.
### components
* Arduino
* Joystick
* 8x8-LED-Matrix (MAX7219)
* Buzzer
* Toggle switch
* Power supply
* (just ask if you want to try other components)


## Project5: Kletterpfad / "Climb the path"
### description
The goal of the traditional game is to get the ball from the bottom to the top. So the first step will be to assemble the missing parts, so that the game works in its traditional way. Next, you can extend the game by adding several electronic components. You can check if you add some LEDs to highlight various destinations or you could add a LCD display to keep score. It s up to you how you redesign the game.
### components
* Arduino
* LEDs
* Display
* Proximity sensor or similar
* Buzzer
* Toggle switch
* Power supply
* (just ask if you want to try other components)


## Project6: Maze
### description
This game features mainly the same components as "Climb the path". You start the game by holding it up and by trying to chase the ball through the maze. The main work consists of trying to extend the game with electronic components. For example, you can add two sensors to let the game know, that you started and ended your try. In addition to this, you can add a LCD display to keep track of the amount of time that you needed to achieve the maze. Or you could add a countdown.
### components
* Arduino
* LEDs
* Display
* Proximity sensor or similar
* Buzzer
* Toggle switch
* Power supply
* (just ask if you want to try other components)


## Project7: React-Game
### description
This game is an adaptation of "Musical Chairs" or "Going to Jerusalem". In this case,  there are no people moving around chairs, but there are LEDs moving around on the prepared box. With the various components, you can create your own version of this game. Maybe you are also able to add some sound to the game.
### components
* Arduino
* LEDs
* Display
* Proximity sensor or similar
* Buzzer
* Toggle switch
* Power supply
* (just ask if you want to try other components)
